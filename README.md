# SSI-stacked-ensemble-predictive-algorithmic-model


The code delineates the development of stacked ensemble algorithmic model that predicts SSI after posterior lumbar surgery (laminectomy and/or discectomy) without fusion for spinal degenertive diseases.

We welcome the model to be explored by the scientific community via its implementation on diverse patient populations and spine pathologies.
